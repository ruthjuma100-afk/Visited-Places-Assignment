## Travel Tracker

---

### Project Description

Travel Tracker is a simple web application that allows users to keep track of places they have visited. Each destination is recorded with details such as location, time of year, notes, and landmarks.
The application uses JavaScript constructor functions and prototypes to manage place data and applies Test-Driven Development (TDD) to ensure the business logic works as expected. When a user clicks on a place name, the stored details are displayed on the page.

### Setup Instructions

1. To run this project locally:

- git Clone: https://github.com/ruthjuma100-afk/Visited-Places-Assignment.git

- Ensure the following files are in the same folder:

- index.html

- script.js

- README.md

- Open index.html in a modern web browser

- Open the browser Developer Console to view TDD test results

- Use the form to add places and click on a place name to view its details

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:

- Tests are written before implementing the business logic

- A minimal custom testing helper is used (without external libraries)

- Tests verify:

~ Correct creation of a Place object

~ Proper addition of landmarks

~ Accurate retrieval of place details

~ Test results are displayed in the browser console using pass/fail messages

**Example output:**
✅ Place constructor creates a new place
✅ Landmark is added to a place
❌ Notes should not be empty

## Technologies Used

- HTML – Structure of the application

- CSS – Styling and layout of the user interface
